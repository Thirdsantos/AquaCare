# AquaCare: Smart Aquarium Monitoring System

AquaCare is a smart aquarium monitoring system that tracks and manages key environmental parameters — including **pH**, **temperature**, and **turbidity** — to ensure a healthy aquatic environment.

The system features a **Flask-based backend** that receives sensor data from ESP32, stores logs in **Firebase Realtime Database**, sends alerts through **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**, and includes AI chatbot support to answer user queries. It also calculates **hourly and daily analytics** to help users monitor trends over time.
